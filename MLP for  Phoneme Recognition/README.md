## HW1 MLP | Phoneme Recognition

- <b>HW1P1</b>
Numpy implementation of activation functions, loss functions, batch normalization, forward pass and backward pass, just like Pytorch does.

- <b>HW1P2</b>
Using knowledge of feedforward neural networks and apply it to speech recognition task. The provided dataset consists of audio recordings (utterances) and their phoneme state (subphoneme) lables. The data comes from articles published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that are read aloud and labelled using the original text.
The job is to identify the phoneme state label for each frame in the test dataset. It is important to note that utterances are of variable length.
