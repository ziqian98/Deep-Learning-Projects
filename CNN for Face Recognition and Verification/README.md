## CNN for Face Recognition and Verification

- <b>Part1</b>
Numpy implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks libraries.

- <b>Part2</b>
 Face Classification and Verification using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Given an image of a personâ€™s face, the task of classifying the ID of the face is known as face classification. The input to the system will be a face image and the system will have to predict the ID of the face. The ground truth will be present in the training data and the network will be doing an N-way classification to get the prediction. The system is provided with a validation set for fine-tuning the model.
